      <H1>&lt;Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?&gt;</H1>
      <hr/>
      <h2>It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.</h2>
      <h3>It’s a Sith legend.</h3>
      <p>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, 
          so powerful <span>and so wise he could use the Force</span> to influence 
          the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the 
          dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br/>
          <pre>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities 
              some consider to be unnatural.</pre> <p>He became so powerful… 
              the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which 
              eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his 
              apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him 
              in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, 
              but not himself.</p>
